%Given a Matrix A 
%Create a row vector of 1's that has same number of elements as A has rows. 
%Create a column vector of 1's that has the same number of elements as A has columns. 
%Using matrix multiplication, assign the product of the row vector, the matrix A, and the column vector (in this order) to the variable result. 

A = [1:5; 6:10; 11:15; 16:20];
size(A);
row_vector=A(1:4);
row_vector(1:4)=1
column_vector=A(1,1:5);
column_vector(1,1:5)=1;
column_vector=column_vector
result=row_vector*A*column_vector
