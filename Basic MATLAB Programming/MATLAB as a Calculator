%We borrowed $1000 at a 10% annual interest rate. If we did not make a payment for two years, and assuming there is no penalty for non-payment, how much do we owe now? Assign the result to a variable called debt.

principal=1000;
rate_of_interest=10/100;
time=2;
debt=principal*(rate_of_interest+1)^time
