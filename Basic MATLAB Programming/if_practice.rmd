%% Write a function called picker that takes three input arguments called condition, in1 and in2 in this order. The argument condition is a logical. If it is true, the function assigns the value of in1 to the output argument out,  otherwise, it assigns the value of in2 to out.

% function
function out=picker(condition,in1,in2)
if condition==1;
    out=in1;
else
    out=in2;
end

% function call
out = picker(true,1,2)
out = picker(false,1,2)

%% Write a function called eligible that helps the admission officer of the Graduate School of Vanderbilt University decide whether the applicant is eligible for admission based on GRE scores. The function takes two positive scalars called v and q as input. They represent the percentiles of the verbal and quantitative portions of the GRE respectively. You do not need to check the input. The applicant is eligible if the average percentile is at least 92% and both of the individual percentiles are over 88%. The function returns the logical true or false.

% function
function admit= eligible(v, q)
avg=(v+q)/2;
if (avg>=92 && v>88 && q>88)
    admit=true;
else 
    admit=false;
end

% function call
admit = eligible(96,89)
admit = eligible(88,99)
admit = eligible(92,91)
